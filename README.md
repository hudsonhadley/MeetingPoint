This algorithm calculates the best meeting point from a group of coordinates. It does this by trying to minimize the average distance from all the points as well as the difference between the greatest and smallest differences in a genetic algorithm. To run the algorithm, another file must be added calles cities.csv. This csv file should contain a Name column, a Latitude column, and a Longitude column. The algorithm will then read from this file and try to find the best point through a genetic algorithm.
